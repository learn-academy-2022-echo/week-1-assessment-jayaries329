# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Researched answer:
Pair programming is an efficient way for two programmers to work together at one workstation and develop software. One, the driver, writes code while the other (the navigator) reviews, proofreads and checks the code as he or she writes it. The two programmers switch roles whenever needed.
